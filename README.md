## Form-Validation

This JavaScript code ensures that all the necessary information is filled out correctly before a form can be submitted.
It checks for errors in the user's input for their name, phone number, email, and message, and gives feedback if anything is wrong.

Name Validation: The form checks if the user has provided a full name (first and last name).
If not, it shows an error saying either "Name is required" or "Write full name" if the format is incorrect.

Phone Validation: The phone number must be exactly 10 digits, and only numbers are allowed.
If this isnâ€™t followed, an error appears stating "Phone no. should be 10 digits" or "Only digits please."

Email Validation: The form checks that the email is written correctly with the standard format (e.g., example@domain.com).
If not, it displays an "Email invalid" message.

Message Validation: The message must have a minimum of 30 characters.
If it's too short, the code informs the user how many more characters are needed.

If all the inputs are correct, a checkmark appears beside the input fields.
If there are errors, a message "Please fix error to submit" is displayed, prompting the user to correct them.
